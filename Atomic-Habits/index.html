<p>Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.</p>
<p>You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.</p>
<p>Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.</p>
<p>Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.</p>
<p>Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.           </p>
<p>If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.</p>
<p>Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.                </p>
<p>If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed what James calls, “Plateau of Latent Potential.”</p>
<p>When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success.                </p>
<p>The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.                </p>
<p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.</p>
<p>Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.</p>
<p>Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.</p>
<p>Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.</p>
<p>An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.</p>
<p>If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.</p>
<p>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</p>
