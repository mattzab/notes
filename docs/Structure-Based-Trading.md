# Support & Resistance - Basics
* Clear all indicators from screen
* Find major levels of support and resistance
* Ignore minor levels
* Works on all timeframes
* Look for levels where price has bounced off of the level multiple times (either as support or resistance)

# Marking Levels
* Move into a higher timeframe to find S/R levels
* Mark 2 levels above, and 2 levels below, price
* Make trading decisions in lower timeframe than the one you marked
* Use either horizontal lines or boxes to mark major levels of market structure
* Treat candle bodies with higher priority than wicks

# Trends
* UP trend when the market is making higher highs and higher lows
* The trend doesn't end until the most recent level of support is broken

# Taking a trade
* Only trade in a trend (usually)
* When price breaks above a level, wait for a pullback to that level, then buy
* Possible sell point is next resistance level up
* If price breaks through next resistance level, expect a pullback and rebound off the new support level (same level as resistance)

# Range trading
* After price consolidations, price typically continues the previous trend
* Only take trades near the edge of the range bondary
* Never buy in a range expecting counter-trend movement

# 21 - EMA
* The 21 day EMA can be used as a "magnet" for price
* Better trades *usually* happen around the 21 EMA (not always)

# Counter Trend Trades
* Take profits early, don't expect trend reversal
