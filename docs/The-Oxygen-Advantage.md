# Breath Light to Breath Right
* Nose breath only
* Nose hairs shouldn't move while breathing
* Breathing should be in stomach, not chest
* Slight natural pause after exhale

# Overbreathing leads to
* Impaired release of oxygen from red blood cells (Bohr Effect)
* Constrictions of smooth muscle in blood vessels and airways
* Reduced oxygenation of working muscles and organs, including heart & brain
* Increased acidity and fatigue during exercise, limited sports performance
* Negative effects to overall health

# Proper breathing leads to
* Easier breathing with reduced breathlessness during exercise
* Naturally increased production of EPO & red blood cells
* Improve oxygenation of working muscles and organs
* Reduces lactic acid buildup & fatigue
* Improved running economy & VO2 Max

# BOLT - Body Oxygen Level Test
* Breathe normally for 10 minutes
* Take a normal breath in, then a normal exhale, and hold
* Time the breath hold
* Hold until you experience a natural desire to breathe- not holding as long as possible, just until need for air
* Time is your score. Ideal target is 40+

# Basic Breath Hold Exercise
* While walking, take a gentle breath in, then out, then hold
* walk 10 - 15 paces
* Gently release and breathe lightly for 30 seconds or 50 paces
* Repeat
* Increase Hold paces as you are able to, over time
* Perform this exercise for 10 -15 minutes

# Increase EPO
* 24% EPO increase, peaked at 3 hours after the final breath hold, returned to baseline 2 hours later.
* 3 sets of 5 maximum duration breath holds, with each set separated by 10 minutes of rest.
* Increase EPO by 24 to 36% by lowering blood oxygen saturation to lower than 91% for 24 seconds and 26 seconds respectively
