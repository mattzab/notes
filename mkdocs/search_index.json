            "text": "The New Rules\n\n\nHow to Become the Smartest Person\u2026in Any Room\n\n\nNegotiators must be active listeners in order to gain the trust of the other party.\n\n\nMirroring\n\n\n\n\nThe late-night FM DJ voice: Basically, keep it calm and slow. Use this selectively to make a point. When done properly, the late-night FM DJ voice has the power to create an aura of authority and trust without making the other party defensive.\n\n\nThe playful/positive voice: This should be your default voice.  It\u2019s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging.\n\n\nThe direct/assertive voice: This should be used as rarely as possible because this has the potential to create pushback.\n\n\n\n\nMirroring works magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said because we fear what is different and find comfort in similarity. Using mirroring encourages the other party to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your party some time, and eventually reveal their strategy.\n\n\nA study by psychologist Richard Wiseman on two groups of waiters concluded that the average tip of the waiters who mirrored was 70 percent more than of those who used positive reinforcement.\n\n\nThe five-step process to own any negotiation process is:\n\n\n\n\nUse the late-night FM DJ voice;\n\n\nStart with phrases like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d;\n\n\nMirror;\n\n\nUse silence effectively;\n\n\nand Repeat.\n\n\n\n\nLabeling\n\n\nDon\u2019t Feel Their Pain, Label It\n\n\nLabeling is a way of validating someone\u2019s emotion by acknowledging it. The first step to labeling is detecting the other party\u2019s emotional state. The trick to spotting feelings is to pay close attention to changes people undergo when they respond to external events. And more often than not, in a negotiation scenario, these external events are your words. Once you\u2019ve spotted an emotion you want to highlight, the next step is to label it aloud. Labels can be phrased as statements or questions. Labels almost always begin with the following phrases:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt seems like\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt looks like\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt sounds like\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\nMastering \"No\"\n\n\nHow to Generate Momentum and Make It Safe to Reveal the Real Stakes\n\n\nPushing for a hard \u201cYes\u201d doesn\u2019t get you any closer to a victory. It only irks the other party. Contrary to popular belief, \u201cNo\u201d is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it.\n\n\nIn a negotiation scenario, \u201cNo\u201d provides a great opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don\u2019t want.\n\n\n\u201cNo\u201d can often mean:\n\n\n\n\nI am not yet ready to agree;\n\n\nYou make me feel uncomfortable;\n\n\nI don\u2019t understand;\n\n\nI can\u2019t afford it;\n\n\nI need more information;\n\n\nI\u2019d prefer talking to someone else.\n\n\n\n\nAnd there are three kinds of \u201cYes\u201d:\n\n\n\n\nCounterfeit: This is one where the other party plans on saying \u201cNo\u201d but feels that a \u201cYes\u201d is an easier escape route.\n\n\nConfirmation: This is a generally innocent, reflexive response to a black or white question. \n\n\nCommitment: This is the real deal, one that most often leads to a definite outcome such as the signing of a contract. But given that these three sound almost the same, you\u2019ll have to learn to recognize which one is being used.\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to sell something, don\u2019t start with \u201cDo you have a few minutes to talk?\u201d Instead ask, \u201cIs now a bad time to talk?\u201d Either you get \u201cYes, it is a bad time\u201d followed by a good time or a request to go away, or you get \u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u201d and total focus.\n\n\nAs you can see, a \u201cNo\u201d can do a lot:\n\n\n\n\nIt can allow the real issues to be brought forth.\n\n\nIt protects you from making poor decisions\u2014and course-correcting ineffective ones.\n\n\nIt slows things down, giving you time to analyze decisions and agreements.\n\n\nIt helps you feel safe, secure, and emotionally comfortable.\n\n\nIt moves everyone\u2019s efforts forward.\n\n\nSaying \u201cNo\u201d makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control, so trigger it. That\u2019s why \u201cIs now a bad time to talk?\u201d is always better than \u201cDo you have a few minutes to talk?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf a potential business partner is ignoring you, contact them with a clear and concise \u201cNo\u201d-oriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away. \u201cHave you given up on this project?\u201d works wonders.\n\n\nThat's Right\n\n\nThe Two Words that Immediately Transform Any Negotiation\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201c\u2014the two words that can transform any negotiation. \u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d is better than \u201cyes.\u201d Strive for it. Reaching \u201cthat\u2019s right\u201d in a negotiation creates breakthroughs.\n\n\nUse a summary to trigger a \u201cthat\u2019s right.\u201d The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing.\n\n\nBend Their Reality\n\n\nHow to Shape What Is Fair\n\n\n\u201cFair\u201d\u2014the most powerful word in any negotiation scenario. To become a great negotiator, you must earn the reputation of being a fair one.\n\n\nTo get real leverage in a tough negotiation, you have to persuade the other party that they have something to lose if the deal falls through.\n\n\nHere\u2019s how you can do that:\n\n\n\n\nAnchor their emotions: To bend the other party\u2019s sense of reality, you need to start with the basics of empathy. You need to be able to audit and acknowledge their fears. By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other party\u2019s loss aversion so that they\u2019ll jump at the chance to avoid it.\n\n\nLet the other guy go first: Going first is not necessarily the best thing when it comes to negotiating price. Let the other side anchor monetary negotiations. By letting them anchor you also might get lucky: for instance, Chris has had many negotiation experiences when the other party\u2019s first offer was higher than the closing figure he had in mind. If he\u2019d gone first they would have agreed and he would have left with either the winner\u2019s curse or buyer\u2019s remorse. However, this could have a counter-effect. You need to be prepared to physically withstand the first offer. If the other party is a tough one, they may just end up bending your perception of reality.\n\n\nEstablish a range:  Establish a ballpark figure with credible references to support your statement. For instance, instead of saying, \u201cI\u2019m worth $110,000,\u201d say, \u201cAt top places like Acme Corp., people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000.\u201d That gets your point across without making the other party defensive.\n\n\nPivot to non-monetary terms: Make your offer seem reasonable by offering things that aren\u2019t important to you but could be important to them. Or, if their offer is low you could ask for things that matter more to you than them.\n\n\nWhen you talk numbers, use odd ones: Numbers that end in a \u20180\u2019 tend to feel like placeholders. But any arbitrary number you throw out that sounds less rounded\u2014 like say, $78,435\u2014feels like a figure that you came to as a result of a thoughtful calculation.\n\n\nSurprise them with a gift: Make the other party feel generous by staking an extreme anchor, and then after their obvious rejection, offering them a completely unrelated surprise gift.\nPeople will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain. Make sure the other party sees that there is something to lose by inaction.\n\n\n\n\nCreate The Illusion of Control\n\n\nHow to Calibrate Questions to Transform Conflict into Collaboration\n\n\nCalibrated questions have the power to educate the other party on what the problem is rather than causing conflict by telling them what the problem is.\n\n\nHere are some calibrated questions that Chris uses in almost every negotiation, depending on the situation:\n\n\n\n\nWhat about this is important to you?\n\n\nHow can I help make this better for us?\n\n\nHow would you like me to proceed?\n\n\nWhat is it that brought us into this situation?\n\n\nHow can we solve this problem?\n\n\nWhat are we trying to accomplish here?\n\n\nHow am I supposed to do that?\nCalibrated questions make the other party feel like they\u2019re in charge, but it\u2019s really you who is driving the conversation.\n\n\n\n\nGuarantee Execution\n\n\nHow to Spot Liars and Ensure Follow-Through from Everyone Else\n\n\nNegotiators are decision architects. As a negotiator, you have to dynamically and adaptively design every element of the negotiation to get both consent as well as execution.\n\n\nHere are some tactics, tools, and methods for using subtle verbal and nonverbal forms of communication to understand and modify the mental states of the other party:\n\n\nThe 7-38-55 Percent Rule\n\n\nThe 7-38-55 Percent Rule created by Albert Mehrabian states that only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker\u2019s body language and face.\n\n\nPay close attention to the other party\u2019s tone and body language and identify if it matches with the literal meaning of the words they are trying to convey. If they don\u2019t align, it is quite obvious that they are lying.\n\n\nThe Rule of Three\n\n\nThe Rule of Three is simply getting the other party to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation.\n\n\nThe first time they agree to something, that\u2019s the first instance. For the second instance, you can label or summarize what they said so they answer, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d And the third instance could be a calibrated \u201cHow\u201d or \u201cWhat\u201d question about implementation, something like \u201cWhat do you see as being the most difficult thing to get around?\u201d\n\n\nThe Pinocchio Effect\n\n\nA Harvard Business School study by professor Deepak Malhotra and his colleagues found that on an average, liars use more words than those telling the truth. They also tend to use more third-person pronouns.\n\n\nThe Chris Discount\n\n\nPeople often get tired of hearing their own name. Switch tracks and use your name instead. This creates a sense of \u201cforced empathy\u201d and makes the other party see you as human.\n\n\nBargain Hard\n\n\nHow to Get Your Price\n\n\nWhen you feel that you\u2019re being dragged into a hard bargain, you can switch tracks to non-monetary issues that make your final price. For instance, if you\u2019re trying to close a deal, you can choose an encouraging tone of voice, and ask \u201cLet\u2019s put price off to the side for a moment and talk about what would make this a good deal?\u201d Or \u201cWhat else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?\u201d\n\n\nWhen the going gets tough, you need to shake things up and get the other party out of their rigid mindset.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to win a deal from your competitors, pitch statements like \u201cWhy would you ever do business with me? Your existing service provider seems great!\u201d The \u201cwhy\u201d can coax the other party into working with you.\n\n\nUsing the word \u201cI\u201d is also great at preventing confrontation. For instance, if you were to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that doesn\u2019t work for me,\u201d the word \u201cI\u201d brings the other party\u2019s attention back on to you.\n\n\nThe key is to never be needy. Remember, the person across the table is never the issue, the unsolved deal is.\n\n\nThe Ackerman Model\n\n\nThe Ackerman Model is an offer-counteroffer method. The six-step process is:\n\n\n\n\nSet your target price (your goal).\n\n\nSet your first offer at 65 percent of your target price.\n\n\nCalculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).\n\n\nUse lots of empathy and different ways of saying \u201cNo\u201d to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.\n\n\nWhen calculating the final amount, use precise, non-round numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight.\n\n\nOn your final number, throw in a non-monetary item (that they probably don\u2019t want) to show you\u2019re at your limit.\nBefore you head into a negotiation, carefully prepare your Ackerman plan. This will ideally help you get the bargain and prevent the other party from trying to milk your deal for the maximum value.\n\n\n\n\nFind The Black Swan\n\n\nBlack Swans are hidden elements that can totally change the negotiation if uncovered and used.\n\n\n\u201cRemember that you are a Black Swan,\u201d says Nassim Nicholas Taleb in the book \u201cThe Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable.\u201d The book focuses on the extreme impact of certain kinds of rare and unpredictable events (outliers) and humans\u2019 tendency to find simplistic explanations for these events retrospectively. This theory has since become known as the Black Swan theory.\n\n\nAs a negotiator, you need to instill that element of fear in the other party which makes them feel like they have everything to lose if the deal falls through. According to Chris, there are three types of leverage: Positive, Negative, and Normative.\n\n\n\n\nPositive leverage: This is when you as a negotiator can withhold or provide what the other party wants.\n\n\nNegative leverage: This is your ability as a negotiator to make the other party suffer.\n\n\nNormative leverage: This is when you analyze the other party\u2019s stance and use it to advance your position.\nBlack Swans are leverage multipliers. Discovering Black Swans that give you normative leverage can be as easy as questioning the other party\u2019s beliefs and actively listening. You want to absorb what they speak and mirror it back to them.\n\n\n\n\nLet your known knowns guide you, but don\u2019t let them blind you from what you don\u2019t know. Every case is new, so be open, flexible, and adaptable.\n\n\nMove the discussion away from the deal, dig into worldviews. Take the discussion away from the negotiation table and into the emotions and life of the other party. That\u2019s where Black Swans live.  People find comfort in similarity. They are more likely to concede to someone who they have common beliefs with. You need to try and find that common ground.",

Here\u2019s how you can do that:   Anchor their emotions: To bend the other party\u2019s sense of reality, you need to start with the basics of empathy. You need to be able to audit and acknowledge their fears. By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other party\u2019s loss aversion so that they\u2019ll jump at the chance to avoid it.  Let the other guy go first: Going first is not necessarily the best thing when it comes to negotiating price. Let the other side anchor monetary negotiations. By letting them anchor you also might get lucky: for instance, Chris has had many negotiation experiences when the other party\u2019s first offer was higher than the closing figure he had in mind. If he\u2019d gone first they would have agreed and he would have left with either the winner\u2019s curse or buyer\u2019s remorse. However, this could have a counter-effect. You need to be prepared to physically withstand the first offer. If the other party is a tough one, they may just end up bending your perception of reality.  Establish a range:  Establish a ballpark figure with credible references to support your statement. For instance, instead of saying, \u201cI\u2019m worth $110,000,\u201d say, \u201cAt top places like Acme Corp., people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000.\u201d That gets your point across without making the other party defensive.  Pivot to non-monetary terms: Make your offer seem reasonable by offering things that aren\u2019t important to you but could be important to them. Or, if their offer is low you could ask for things that matter more to you than them.  When you talk numbers, use odd ones: Numbers that end in a \u20180\u2019 tend to feel like placeholders. But any arbitrary number you throw out that sounds less rounded\u2014 like say, $78,435\u2014feels like a figure that you came to as a result of a thoughtful calculation.  Surprise them with a gift: Make the other party feel generous by staking an extreme anchor, and then after their obvious rejection, offering them a completely unrelated surprise gift.\nPeople will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain. Make sure the other party sees that there is something to lose by inaction.",

Here are some calibrated questions that Chris uses in almost every negotiation, depending on the situation:   What about this is important to you?  How can I help make this better for us?  How would you like me to proceed?  What is it that brought us into this situation?  How can we solve this problem?  What are we trying to accomplish here?  How am I supposed to do that?\nCalibrated questions make the other party feel like they\u2019re in charge, but it\u2019s really you who is driving the conversation.",

As a negotiator, you have to dynamically and adaptively design every element of the negotiation to get both consent as well as execution.  Here are some tactics, tools, and methods for using subtle verbal and nonverbal forms of communication to understand and modify the mental states of the other party:  The 7-38-55 Percent Rule  The 7-38-55 Percent Rule created by Albert Mehrabian states that only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker\u2019s body language and face.  Pay close attention to the other party\u2019s tone and body language and identify if it matches with the literal meaning of the words they are trying to convey. If they don\u2019t align, it is quite obvious that they are lying.  The Rule of Three  The Rule of Three is simply getting the other party to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation.  The first time they agree to something, that\u2019s the first instance. For the second instance, you can label or summarize what they said so they answer, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d And the third instance could be a calibrated \u201cHow\u201d or \u201cWhat\u201d question about implementation, something like \u201cWhat do you see as being the most difficult thing to get around?\u201d  The Pinocchio Effect  A Harvard Business School study by professor Deepak Malhotra and his colleagues found that on an average, liars use more words than those telling the truth. They also tend to use more third-person pronouns.  The Chris Discount  People often get tired of hearing their own name. Switch tracks and use your name instead. This creates a sense of \u201cforced empathy\u201d and makes the other party see you as human.",

            "text": "How to Get Your Price  When you feel that you\u2019re being dragged into a hard bargain, you can switch tracks to non-monetary issues that make your final price. For instance, if you\u2019re trying to close a deal, you can choose an encouraging tone of voice, and ask \u201cLet\u2019s put price off to the side for a moment and talk about what would make this a good deal?\u201d Or \u201cWhat else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?\u201d  When the going gets tough, you need to shake things up and get the other party out of their rigid mindset.  If you\u2019re trying to win a deal from your competitors, pitch statements like \u201cWhy would you ever do business with me? Your existing service provider seems great!\u201d The \u201cwhy\u201d can coax the other party into working with you.  Using the word \u201cI\u201d is also great at preventing confrontation. For instance, if you were to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that doesn\u2019t work for me,\u201d the word \u201cI\u201d brings the other party\u2019s attention back on to you.  The key is to never be needy. Remember, the person across the table is never the issue, the unsolved deal is.  The Ackerman Model  The Ackerman Model is an offer-counteroffer method. The six-step process is:   Set your target price (your goal).  Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price.  Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).  Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying \u201cNo\u201d to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.  When calculating the final amount, use precise, non-round numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight.  On your final number, throw in a non-monetary item (that they probably don\u2019t want) to show you\u2019re at your limit.\nBefore you head into a negotiation, carefully prepare your Ackerman plan. This will ideally help you get the bargain and prevent the other party from trying to milk your deal for the maximum value.",

            "text": "Black Swans are hidden elements that can totally change the negotiation if uncovered and used.  \u201cRemember that you are a Black Swan,\u201d says Nassim Nicholas Taleb in the book \u201cThe Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable.\u201d The book focuses on the extreme impact of certain kinds of rare and unpredictable events (outliers) and humans\u2019 tendency to find simplistic explanations for these events retrospectively. This theory has since become known as the Black Swan theory.  As a negotiator, you need to instill that element of fear in the other party which makes them feel like they have everything to lose if the deal falls through. According to Chris, there are three types of leverage: Positive, Negative, and Normative.   Positive leverage: This is when you as a negotiator can withhold or provide what the other party wants.  Negative leverage: This is your ability as a negotiator to make the other party suffer.  Normative leverage: This is when you analyze the other party\u2019s stance and use it to advance your position.\nBlack Swans are leverage multipliers. Discovering Black Swans that give you normative leverage can be as easy as questioning the other party\u2019s beliefs and actively listening. You want to absorb what they speak and mirror it back to them.   Let your known knowns guide you, but don\u2019t let them blind you from what you don\u2019t know. Every case is new, so be open, flexible, and adaptable.  Move the discussion away from the deal, dig into worldviews. Take the discussion away from the negotiation table and into the emotions and life of the other party. That\u2019s where Black Swans live.  People find comfort in similarity. They are more likely to concede to someone who they have common beliefs with. You need to try and find that common ground.",
